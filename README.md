# Natural-Language-Processing
This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that I have worked on. The projects included are Article Spinner, Spam Detection, Recommender System, and Sentiment Analysis.Each project has been implemented using various NLP techniques and methodologies to provide a functional and efficient solution. The Article Spinner provides an innovative way to rewrite text using NLP techniques. The Spam Detection model is designed to identify spam emails and preventthem from reaching the recipient's inbox. The Recommender System offers recommendations based on the cosine similarity.Lastly, the Sentiment Analysis model is used to determine the sentiment of a given piece of text. Each project has been thoroughly documented to provide a clear understanding of the implementation process, evaluation metrics, and inference results.
